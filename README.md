## Introduction to Modern Data Engineering with Snowflake

Welcome! I'm glad you've made it this far in the interview process! The repository is segmented into modules to highlight specific types of skills within a Snowflake architecture. Coding proficiency in SQL, Python, and Swift will be showcased through thr module. Please continue reading for instructions on how to connect to resources and view outputs. 


#### How to use this repo throughout the course:

* Keep the URL to this repo handy, so that you can easily find and use any code referenced by the instructor during the course

* Clone the repo to your local computing environment (recommended)

> **Note:** A couple modules that make use of Snowflake's command line interface, Snowflake CLI. To successfully follow along during those exercises, you'll need to have the repo cloned to your local computing environment, so that the Snowflake CLI can make use of files and code within this repo.

#### How to clone the repo to your local computing environment:

To clone the repo, run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/modern-data-engineering-snowflake.git
```

You can then open the folder in your preferred code editor. Throughout the course, the instructor will use Visual Studio Code as the code editor.
